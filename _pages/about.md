Hi! I'm a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Stanford University advised by [Stefan Wager](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/index.html) and [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/). My research interests revolve around the question of how to use data and computation to assist with policy making and implementation in social domains. Some projects I'm currently involved with include (with technical keywords):
- Reducing rates of incarceration by decreasing the number of people that fail to appear in court through text reminder and transportation assistance interventions. This is a collaboration with Santa Clara County's Public Defenders Office. (contextual multi-armed bandits, algorithmic fairness, constrained and multi-objective optimization).
<!-- -  to to help people get to pretrial hearings by offering transportation assistance. On the technical side we're using contextual bandits which are budget contrained and optimizing for multiple objectives (expected reward and fairness across protected groups). -->
- Analysing the effectiveness of wildfire mitigation strategies (e.g. prescribed burnings or removing hazardous fuels in forests) in California by drawing on remote sensing and forest service datasets. (spatio-temporal causal inference, remote sensing)
- How to design randomized controlled trials when we care about being fair to particular subgroups: e.g. if we particularly want good estimates of treatment effects for vulnerable or historically understudied groups.

I also spend my time with these communities: [Computing & Society](https://stanford-cscs.github.io/) and the [Stanford Tri Team](https://www.stanfordtriathlon.com/).

If you would like to meet or talk about any of the above, please reach out!
