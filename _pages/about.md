Hi! I'm a 2nd year computer science PhD student at Stanford University advised by [Stefan Wager](https://web.stanford.edu/~swager/index.html) and [Emma Brunskill](https://cs.stanford.edu/people/ebrun/). My current research interests revolve around developing and using causal inference and sequential decision making methods for a variety of application areas (including public policy, sustainability, healthcare). Here are some projects I'm currently involved with:
- Working with Santa Clara County's Public Defenders Office to to help people get to pretrial hearings by offering transportation assistance. On the technical side we're using contextual bandits which are budget contrained and optimizing for multiple objectives (expected reward and fairness across protected groups).
- Using causal inference to analyze the effectiveness of wildfire mitigation strategies (e.g. prescribed burnings).

I also spend my time with [Computing & Society](https://stanford-cscs.github.io/) and the [Stanford Tri Team](https://www.stanfordtriathlon.com/).

If you would like to talk about any of the above, please reach out!
